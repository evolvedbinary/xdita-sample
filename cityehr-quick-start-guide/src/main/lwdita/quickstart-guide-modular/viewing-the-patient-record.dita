            <title>Summary View and Charting</title>
            <p>When you first access a patient's record, you will be shown the Summary page, which
                includes a selection of various summary views. </p>
            <ol id="ol_dsr_14v_vcc">
                <li>
                    <p>Initially, you should see the summary view for Bone Chemistry – Messages. These
                        are bone chemistry results that have been sent to the cityEHR as messages from
                        the laboratory which performed the tests. (At least we are pretending this in
                        the test data, although the results used were originally generated in this way)
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>Initially, this summary just shows the most recent set of Bone Chemistry results. Now change the drop down at the top right of the pane to Historic Data and you should see the complete list of historic results for the patient. </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select two or three of the analytes (CTX, P1NP, Calcium, etc) that you want to
                        view on a chart, by selecting the check boxes to the left of each line. Note
                        that you only need to check the box in one set of results; all boxes for the
                        same analyte in other results sets will also be selected. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>As you select the analytes, a summary of the number selected and the overall data range covered by the selected results will be updated at the top of the pane.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once you have selected two or three analytes, press the Chart button that should
                        now be visible at the top right of the pane. See figure below. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>On pressing the Chart button you should see a new dialogue window with charts of
                        the analytes you selected. There are various parameters at the top of this
                        dialogue that you can use to adjust the charts that are displayed. </p>

                    <p>Once you have seen enough, press the Close button at the top of the dialogue to

            <p>The Events page is used to access the full longitudinal record of events recorded for the patient. Since cityEHR must preserve a proper history of the patient's information, it is not possible to change any of the recorded events that have been committed (published); but it is possible to add annotations. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>In the Events page, select the historic event that you wish to annotate – for
                        example the HADs assessment. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>To annotate the event, click the small Flag button to the top right of the record view. This will display the annotations for this event. </p>

                    <p>Click the ‘+’ button at the top left to add a new annotation. </p>

                    <p>You can now enter the Type and Comments for the annotation – then press the Save
                        button that appears in the top right menu to commit your annotation to the
                        record. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>Once saved, your annotation is stored as its own event in the historic record for the patient, associated with the event it annotates. </p>

                    <p>Annotations can also be made as ways to notify other clinical users about events
                        in the patient record. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>To do this, add a new annotation but this time use the Action drop-down menu to
                        select the users you wish to notify. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Note that for a fresh installation of cityEHR, with only the single admin user,
                        you should only be able to notify roles of user, so select Notify Role as the
                        action and then Administrator as the role in the drop-down. </p>

                    <p>Once saved, the annotation is stored with details of the users you have chosen to notify and they will be altered through a message in their InTray (as we will see later on in this Quick Guide </p>
